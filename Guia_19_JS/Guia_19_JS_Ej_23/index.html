        <h2 id="texto">Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Don't call
            me
            a mindless
            philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now
            come out before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting
            in
            there!
            I'm going to regret this. There goes
            another one. Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited. That's funny, the
            damage
            doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you
            sure this things safe? Close up formation. You'd better let her loose. Almost there! I can't hold them! It’s
            away!
            It's a hit! Negative. Negative! It didn't go in. It
            just impacted on the surface. Red Leader, we're right above you. Turn to point... oh-five, we'll cover for
            you.
            Stay
            there... I just lost my starboard engine. Get
            set to make your attack run. The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those
            transmissions
            you
            intercepted? What have you done with
            those plans? Wc intercepted no transmissions. Aah... This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.
            If
            this
            is a consular ship...were is the
            Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I
            want
            her
            alive! There she is! Set for stun! She'll
            be all right. Inform Lord Vader wc have a prisoner. What a piece of junk. She'll make point five beyond the
            speed of
            light. She may not look like much, but
            she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so
            if
            you'll
            hurry aboard we'll get out of here. Hello, sir.</h2>
